This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook which uses Pandas to import and analyze item purchase data for an online game called "Heroes of Pymoli".

the Jupyter Notebook is broken up into nine sections, each section take the player data and breaks it down to show multiple game statistics such as players by gender, players by age and purchase trends by age, gender and in-game items.

Specifically we break the data down into the following categories:
1.) Total Players
2.) Total Purchases of in-game items
3.) Total Players broken into gender demogrpahics
4.) Total Purchases by gender
5.) Total players by age group
6.) Total purchases by age group
7.) Top spenders by dollar amount spent
8.) Top items sold by dollar amount
9.) Top items sold by number of purchases

Congifuration and Operation: Make sure you have the CSV containing game data in the correct folder so it can be properly read into Jupyter Notebooks. After downloading the .CSV and the Jupyter Notebook file open your terminal and turn on PythonData: conda activate PythonData, then open Juypter Notebooks: Jupyter Notebook. Once Jupyter Notebooks is opened make sure to run the imports at the top or the rest of the code sections won't work!
